I created a Rule and scheduled it to run on a weekly basis in occurence of every 7 days from the start date for a specific day of the week at a specific time.
Created rules with same configuration for every day of the week, so that lambda triggers daily at a specific time and patients with any startdate can receive messages.
Added the Lambda function under targets.
Added the specific IAM policies.
