DYNAMODB:
Firstly, I created a table in DynamoDb named PatientReminders with PatientID as partition key. 
Then I added the attributes such as Name, Email, StartDate and NotificationTime. StartDate and NotificationTime are written in UTC timezone and ISO8601 format. 
Added the policies in IAM. (DynamoDbfullaccess).
