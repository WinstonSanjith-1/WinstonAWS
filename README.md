Project on AWS.
I have created a automated mailing system using Amazon Web Services such as DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, AWS Event Bridge and AWS SNS.

Some medications which are prescribed by the doctors have a weekly dosage regimen such as VITAMIN D supplements. This can be challenging for patients to follow up. Therefore I created an automation which sends E-mail reminder every week to patients to help them take the supplements on time.
